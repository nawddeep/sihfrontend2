**(Visual: Split screen showing news headlines of paper leaks/fake degrees vs. our sleek Dashboard)**

**Voiceover:**
"In a world where digital trust is paramount, educational fraud and exam malpractices undermine the credibility of our institutions. Paper leaks, impersonation, and fake degree certificates are not just administrative hurdles—they are threats to our nation's integrity.

Introducing **[Project Name]**, the next-generation, AI-powered ecosystem designed for the Smart India Hackathon. We don't just detect fraud; we prevent it."

## 0:30 - 1:15 | Feature 1: AI-Powered Fraud Detection
**(Visual: Student Dashboard > Upload Tab. User uploads a document. Show the scanning animation, heatmap overlay, and confidence score.)**

**Voiceover:**
"Let's start with our core innovation: **AI-Powered Fraud Detection**.
When a student uploads a document, our system doesn't just store it. It *sees* it.

Using advanced computer vision, we instantly scan for anomalies.
*(Pause as heatmap appears)*
Here, the system detects a font mismatch and a tampered seal. The **Anomaly Visualizer** highlights these regions in real-time.
Our **Explainable AI** engine provides a transparent risk score—98% confidence in this case—and explains *why* it was flagged, ensuring fairness and transparency."

## 1:15 - 1:50 | Feature 2: Real-Time Live Monitoring
**(Visual: Switch to Authority/Admin Dashboard. Show the Live Exam Monitor with moving graphs, active user counts, and the map of India.)**

**Voiceover:**
"For exam authorities, situational awareness is key.
Our **Live Monitoring Dashboard** provides a bird's-eye view of the entire exam ecosystem.
We track active sessions, system health, and security alerts in real-time.
Notice the **Geographic Distribution** map—we can pinpoint suspicious activity clusters down to the city level instantly.
If a center reports a breach, the system triggers an automated lockdown protocol."

## 1:50 - 2:20 | Feature 3: Blockchain Verification
**(Visual: Click on a 'Verified' document to open the Blockchain Explorer. Show the block details, timeline, and 'Immutable' badge.)**

**Voiceover:**
"But how do we ensure these records last forever?
Every verified document is anchored to a **Permissioned Blockchain**.
Our **Blockchain Explorer** allows anyone—recruiters, universities, or students—to verify the authenticity of a credential.
You can see the entire **Transaction Timeline**, from issuance to verification.
This creates an **Immutable Audit Trail** that is impossible to tamper with, eliminating the market for fake degrees once and for all."

## 2:20 - 2:45 | Feature 4: Advanced Biometrics & Security
**(Visual: Show the Biometric Mesh Overlay and Liveness Detector animations.)**

**Voiceover:**
"We've also integrated **Advanced Biometrics**.
Our **Liveness Detector** ensures that the person taking the exam is real, not a deepfake or a static image.
We combine face, fingerprint, and iris data for a **Multi-Facet Match** score, ensuring 100% identity assurance."
